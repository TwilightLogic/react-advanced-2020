### Hooks

#### useState

##### Intro

> We do you think while we are pressing the button?
>
> Will the title variable in JSX be changed?

```js
// 1-error-example.js
import React from 'react';

const ErrorExample = () => {
  let title = 'Random Title';

  const handleClick = () => {
    title = 'hello the fucking world';
    console.log('yeah');
  };

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      {/* Do you think the `title` here will be change? */}
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <button type="button" className="btn" onClick={handleClick}>
        change title
      </button>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};

export default ErrorExample;
```

Actually, nothing's happened. WHY?

- We've changed the value, but we are not re-rendering the component.
- We have no way to preserve the value `hello the fucking world` of `title` in between renders as well.

So, here are two things that we want:

1. We want to keep the values between the renders
2. And we also want to trigger the re-render

**Here is the scenario where `useState` comes into play**
